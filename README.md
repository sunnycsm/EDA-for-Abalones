# EDA-for-Abalones
Objective: Exploratory Data Analysis to Determine why original analysis was not successful in predicting age

Background information:

The assignment data are derived from an observational study of abalones. The intent of the investigators was
to predict the age of abalone from physical measurements thus avoiding the necessity of counting growth
rings for aging. Ideally, a growth ring is produced each year of age. Currently, age is determined by drilling
the shell and counting the number of shell rings using a microscope. This is a difficult and time consuming
process. Ring clarity can be an issue. At the completion of the breeding season sexing abalone can be difficult.
Similar difficulties are experienced when trying to determine the sex of immature abalone.
The study was not successful. The investigators concluded additional information would be required such as
weather patterns and location which affect food availability.

Assignment 1 is an exploratory data analysis with the objective to determine why the original
study was not successful in predicting age based on physical characteristics. Assignment 2 will
address development of binary decision rules for harvesting abalones.
